   == INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS ==


Based on LS-120 120MB floppy disk data located at:
ftp://ftp.agilent.com/pub/callpub3/ddt/scope/548xx/Upg_Rec/4_3/
 
This bootable CD was pieced together in February 2010 after many hours of
frustration with an Agilent Infiniium 54825A/54825N Oscilloscope.  It was
constructed using a Windows 98 SE bootable CD image (emulating a Win98 SE
bootable 1.44 MB floppy disk) and the LS-120 floppy recovery disk data at
Agilent's FTP site.

INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 0. If this CD has saved you hours of frustration, e-mail and thank the 
    author. Seriously! He spent hours simplifying the process for others. :-)
  
 1. At the A:\ prompt, type 'R:' (without quotes) and press ENTER.
 
 2. IF you have a mouse connected type 'mouse' (without quotes) and press ENTER.
 
 3. Type 'ghost' (without quotes) and press ENTER.
 
 4. If a message appears titled, 'About NORTON Ghost', select 'OK' either by
    clicking it with the mouse or by pressing ENTER.
 
 5. Select 'Local' by clicking it with the mouse or highlighting it with the 
    arrow keys and pressing ENTER.
 
 6. Select 'Disk' by clicking on it or pressing ENTER. (Note: This should work
    fine for a typical oscilloscope, but if for some strange reason you have
    multiple partitions on your oscilloscope, choose 'Partition' and you're on
    your own from there.  If in doubt, choose 'Disk' like I just told you to.)
 
 7. Select 'From Image' by clicking on it or pressing ENTER.
 
 8. Select 'HP548RCV.GHO' (should allready be highlighted) and press ENTER.
 
 9. Select destination drive (1 should already be highlighted) and press ENTER.
 
 A. Next, on the drive details screen, a new size should already be filled in,
    so click on 'OK' or press TAB until 'OK' is selected and press ENTER.
 
 B. Proceed with disk load? Click on 'Yes' or press TAB until 'Yes' is selected
    and press ENTER. 
 
 C. If prompted to 'Insert next media and press enter to continue...' then
    simply ignore that message and proceed as if you had swapped disks. ;-)
    Click on 'OK' or make sure 'OK' is highlighted and press ENTER.
 
 D. If prompted to 'Insert next media and press enter to continue...' again then
    again ignore that message and proceed as if you had swapped disks. ;-)
    Click on 'OK' or make sure 'OK' is highlighted and press ENTER.

 E. When the recovery process finishes, restart your oscilloscope with the CD 
    removed. Make sure 'Reset Computer' is highlighted, remove CD, press ENTER.

 F. Windows should detect and install the drivers automatically. Windows will
    prompt you to restart the system to complete driver setup. You will need to
    have a keyboard or mouse connected at this point in order to have Windows
    finish the driver installation. Once the system restarts again, you should
    be up and running! You might want to perform self calibration and tests.
